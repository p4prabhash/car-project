                <h1>Enzo Anselmo Giuseppe<span> Maria Ferrari</span></h1>
                <p>The car looks fast too, and was designed by the Ferrari Styling Centre and is also based on the 812 Superfast. Inspiration was also taken from the 365 GTb4 of 1968 with its fastback sleekness. The retractable roof comes down in 14 seconds at speeds of up to 45km/h, and it doesnâ€™t take away from the interior space, according to Ferrari. 
                    Ferrari also said that the aim in developing the 812 GTS was to retain the exhilarating feeling of speed and power, and from what we have seen and heard, it certainly looks like this car will not disappoint. A lot of work was also done to make sure that comfort levels stay at the highest when the top is down even when driving at high speeds. So, while you may want to drive like an F1 driver, you will steel be immersed in the lap of luxury.</p>
